  <h2>6502: specific addons</h2>
    <h3>Numeric value</h3>
   	Although it is the common usage for 6502, a reminder about numeric values. Only hexadecimal values are supported: they must be prefixed with "$" like "$FF".
   	Note that absolute addresses are 16-bit while data and offset (branches) are 8-bit.
    <h3>Data</h3>
    A data is defined by its name (label), its size (BYTE or WORD) and its initial value.<br>
    Note that 6502 is a 8-bit processor: WORD has been added for future usage (device controller supporting 16-bit input)
    Examples: 2 consecutive bytes initialized to zero
      <pre>
H1		BYTE	$00
L1		BYTE	$00
      </pre>
    
    <h3>Directive: ORG</h3>
    "ORG addr" can be added at any place to force next data or instructions to be loaded at a particular address.
        <pre>
     		ORG   $0010
        VAL	BYTE  $FF
        	ORG   $0020
        	LDA   VAL
        </pre>
    VAL is stored at $0010, 1st instruction is loaded at $0020
